    "- Treewidth of a network is used to measure how tree-like a network is. Intuitively, a tree has a treewidth of 1 because the graph can be separated by the removal of a single edge (or vertex) in the network, whereas a cycle requires two edges to be cut and thus has a treewidth of 2. TDs with large widths require larger numbers of vertices to separate a network into two disconnected pieces.\n",
