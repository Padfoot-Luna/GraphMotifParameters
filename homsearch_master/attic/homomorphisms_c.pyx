  """
  Recursive routine to extend partial homomorphism G->H given by partmap to a
  full homomorphism. Finds up to limit solutions. Works correctly on digraphs.
  If a partial map is provided, homomorphism correctness is not checked on set vertices.

  Parameters:
    G         Source Graph.
    H         Target Graph.
              Note that the vertices of both G and H should be hashable values.
    partmap   Partial map {v: f(v)}, empty by default.
    order     Sequence of all the unmapped vertices of G giving the order for
              the backtracking. Already mapped vertices are ignored.
              Defaults to heuristic order_max_adjacent().
              This set does not have to contain all unmapped vertices.
    limit     Maximum number of homomorphisms to look for and return, default 1.
    Ggraphtype, Hgraphtype     The CGraph class to use for C representation of G
              and H. DenseGraph by default.
    check_automorphisms    If >0, check H for authomorphisms (after coloring
              the already targeted vertices) and only try one vertex per orbit.
              check_automorphisms is decreased with every recursion level and
              set to 0 on detection of all singleton orbits.
    onlycount  do not store all mappings, only return the number (still up to limit)

  Returns:
    list of mappings {v: f(v)} or their number (with `onlycout` set)
