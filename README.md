# Goal

The purpose of this project is to implement the algorithms for counting subgrpahs using framework Graph Motif Parameters, and test if our algorithms are more efficient in time.

# Implementations

As defined by Radu Curticapean, Holger Dell, DÃ¡niel Marx in [Homomorphisms Are a Good Basis for Counting Small Subgraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01595)

Different languages are used:

- Python
- C++
